# Resume-Cleaner (Bert Fine-Tuned) 
AI Resume Evaluation System ‚Äì An intelligent resume screening tool that fine-tunes **BERT** on a **resume dataset from Kaggle** to compare resumes with job descriptions. It utilizes **Sentence-BERT similarity scoring** and **AI-powered evaluation (GPT/Gemini API)** to automate recruitment and enhance hiring decisions.

##  Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Resume Screening System** that:
- **Fine-tunes BERT on a Kaggle resume dataset** for better similarity matching.
- Uses **BERT-based similarity scoring** to compare resumes with job descriptions.
- Employs **AI evaluation (GPT/Gemini API)** to provide structured feedback.
- Automates resume screening to assist recruiters in shortlisting candidates efficiently.

##  Features
 **Batch Resume Evaluation** ‚Äì Upload multiple resumes and evaluate them at once.  
 **Fine-Tuned BERT Model** ‚Äì Trained on a **Kaggle resume dataset** for accuracy.  
 **AI-Powered Resume Review** ‚Äì Uses NLP models (Gemini API, OpenAI GPT) to analyze resumes.  
 **Pass/Fail Automation** ‚Äì Automatically moves resumes into `"Pass"` or `"Fail"` folders.  
 **User-Friendly GUI** ‚Äì Built with **Tkinter** for an intuitive interface.

## üñ• How It Works
1. **User downloads and extracts the dataset** from Kaggle.  
2. **Fine-Tuned BERT Model**:
   - The system uses a **pre-trained BERT model** and fine-tunes it on the Kaggle dataset.
   - Resume and job descriptions are encoded with **Sentence-BERT** for similarity scoring.
3. **User selects a folder** containing multiple PDF resumes.  
4. **System processes each resume**:
   - Extracts text using **pdfplumber**.
   - Compares resume with job description using **fine-tuned BERT**.
   - Evaluates qualifications using **AI (GPT/Gemini API)**.
5. **Results are displayed in the GUI**, and resumes are moved to `Pass` or `Fail` folders.
